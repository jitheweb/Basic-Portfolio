        at Greensboro with Businese Administration degree. I have work in many
        differernt business field as account executive, while I was looking for
        career change, I was told about soft development and coding bootcamp
        from close friends, learing coding sounds very exciting and interesting
        that's why I decided to enrolled to this unc coding bootcamp. I am
        ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for
